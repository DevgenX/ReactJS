Stateless Function Components are faster than the class based components

- A lot easier to read and write

- Much easier to test

- Use it if you can

- If you need to use state, you can use class-based components but if only render, use stateless functions

Props and State

- They are both Objects

- Props are used to access methods and aren't mutable

- State are used mostly in object's properties, and can be mutated by using setState method.

JSON.stringify converts the data into a string
JSON.parse converts the data into an object so you can access them into a key-value pair
